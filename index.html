      <h2>About the App</h2>

      <p>This app is currently being developed by me currently</p>

      <p>
        It brings together training schedules, communication, performance
        tracking, and community interaction etc into one simple, modern
        experience specifically for swimming
        <br />
        Everything listed below is a high level abstraction of the features i
        want to add and its only an mvp list
      </p>

      <h2>Built for Coaches</h2>

      <p>
        Coaches can create and manage their entire club directly within the
        app:
      </p>

      <ul class="feature-list">
        <li>Create clubs and fully customisable squads</li>
        <li>Schedule training sessions using a built-in calendar</li>
        <li>Write, save, reuse, and share detailed training sets</li>
        <li>Post squad-specific announcements and updates</li>
        <li>View swimmer personal bests across all pool formats</li>
        <li>Approve members and control access securely</li>
      </ul>

      <p>
        Everything is organised by squad, ensuring swimmers only see what’s
        relevant so theres no confusion or clutter
      </p>

      <h2>Built for swimmers</h2>

      <p>Swimmers get a clear and focused view of training, progress etc</p>

      <ul class="feature-list">
        <li>See upcoming sessions instantly on the dashboard</li>
        <li>view sets for each session (if the coach writes one )</li>
        <li>
          track pb in one place and accurately convert between long/short/yard
          times
        </li>
        <li>celebrate achievements and milestones</li>
        <li>stay connected with coaches and teammates</li>
        <li>ability to track/register attendance maybe</li>
      </ul>

      <h2>Community stuff</h2>

      <p>
        Maybe there could also be a community space with explore pages etc for
        swimmers (still thinking of nuances for now):
      </p>

      <ul class="feature-list">
        <li>
          Coaches can share training sets if they want to with a wider
          community or look at other sets and react/comment on them, and maybe
          export the sets so they can use themselves
        </li>
        <li>Swimmer achievements are posted eg pbs and milestones</li>
        <li>etc ...</li>
      </ul>

      <p>
        Designed to be scalable hopefully, and i try to make sure u only see
        what u need to see so its not extremely confusing
      </p>
      <p>all clubs are in privacy</p>

            The join requests are for swimmers who want to join the club,
            and the coach has to permit them whilst the transfer requests are for swimmers who are in
            the club and want to tranfser to a different squad.

              squad,
              and write a set
